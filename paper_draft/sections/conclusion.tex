\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have established new convergence rate results for stochastic gradient descent on non-convex optimization problems. Our main contributions include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A general $O(1/\eps^4)$ convergence rate for finding $\eps$-approximate stationary points
  \item Improved $O(1/\eps^2)$ rates under additional regularity conditions
  \item Applications to neural network training and matrix factorization
\end{itemize}

Our analysis provides practical insights for step size selection and batch size tuning in deep learning applications.

\paragraph{Future Work.}
Several directions remain open for future investigation:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Extending our results to the distributed and federated learning settings
  \item Tighter analysis under variance reduction techniques
  \item Non-asymptotic bounds for specific neural network architectures
\end{enumerate}
